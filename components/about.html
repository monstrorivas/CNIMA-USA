            <p class="lead">The CNIMA (Centre National et International de Musique et d'Accordéon) is a welcoming, internationally recognized accordion school in France, founded by esteemed teacher Jacques Mornet and award-winning accordionist Nathalie Boucheix.</p>
            <p>Students at CNIMA have achieved remarkable success over the years, earning an impressive 123 awards in international competitions. The school has helped shape several generations of talented French accordionists.</p>
            <p>At the heart of Mornet’s approach is the idea of treating the accordion as a wind instrument rather than a keyboard alone. When the flow of air is used with intention and paired with a sensitive touch on the keys, it opens the door to expressive playing and a truly liberated musicality.</p>
