    <p>Born in Avignon, Jacques Mornet began his career as a schoolteacher in the French village of Le Thor (Vaucluse). His passion for music quickly took root: every Thursday, he transformed his classroom into a small music school that soon welcomed more young musicians than regular pupils. Thanks to this enthusiasm, local officials entrusted him with the creation of a large regional music school.</p>
    <p>Encouraged by his students’ growing success in national and international competitions, he eventually left teaching to direct the music school for several years. Later, together with Auvergne native Nathalie Boucheix, he co-founded the CNIMA. Thirty years later, Jacques Mornet and the CNIMA have achieved one of the most impressive competition records in the world, garnering 128 international first prizes.</p>
    <p>As Secretary General of the World Accordion Confederation (CMA), Professor Mornet is regularly invited to judge major international competitions, lead workshops and masterclasses across the globe, and collaborate with many of the greatest accordionists, teachers, composers, and performers. He has been honored with the Silver Disc from the Gnessin Academy in Moscow and the 2015 Gus Viseur Prize.</p>
